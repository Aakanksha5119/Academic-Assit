            <p>
            On an average a student spends 25% of their study time in searching the qualitative notes to study their subjects. So to provide good academic notes,  subject related youtube links to the students, we  started an online webpage "ACADEMIC ASSIST" for their academic benefits. "ACADEMIC ASSIST" webpage contains the most prominent content collected from our skilled faculty and through our research. A user can select the required document and go through all the content following simple steps. They can access the content and search for different explanation for the same content. "ACADEMIC ASSIST" is a dynamic webpage application built using html,css and Javascript based django framework with powerful backend. "ACADEMIC ASSIST" has multi-vendor system with a user-friendly dashboard. "ACADEMIC ASSIST" is lightning fast and optimized very well for search engines. From this project, we want to build a revolutionary academic content.
